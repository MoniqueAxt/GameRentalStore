## Description

A simple console-based application that simulates renting video games from a retail store.
This project is intended to illustrate fundamental OOP concepts as well basic as use of the Java library.
It uses an [controller class](https://github.com/MoniqueAxt/GameRentalStore/blob/master/src/se/oop/GameRentalController.java) to interface between [Main](https://github.com/MoniqueAxt/GameRentalStore/blob/master/src/se/oop/Main.java) and the relevant classes.

## Application
